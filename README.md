# ER-simulator
This is a application which simulates a real life situation from a hospital. Based on a input where you receive data about the patients (such as: name, illness type, severity of the illness, the moment when they arrive to the hospital) and data about doctors (such as: name,specialzation, if he is surgeon, self capacity for which he can treat) and the number of nurses. The application is able to send the patients in priority queues based on their illness type and severity. Also it is able to make decisions for doctors such as: treatment at home, treatment in the hospital (here the patients are consulted by the nurses periodically), to surgery (after surgery they are also kept in the hospital) or send to tehnicians for detailed investigation, all of this decisions are based on mathematical ecuations and some constants. If the patients are sent to tehnicians, after this they are redistributed again in queues and the doctors respect the decisions from investigations. The application is using Observer pattern so the "road" of a patient is easier to follow. The application receives the number of rounds for which it should go on.
